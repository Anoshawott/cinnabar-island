While research was a primary focus for this project it was strongly data oriented. Datasets had undergone rigourous data cleaning and analysis utilising matplotlib and seaborn libraries. Moreover, inquiring into these research aspects required an analysis of the relevant datasets from different independent sources they are detailed as follows. 

## Life Expectancy & Other Health Indicators
### Data Source Analysis
The dataset used in research was obtained from Kaggle, an online community for data scientists and
machine learners. Owned by Google LLC, Kaggle acts as a public data platform and allows users to find and
publish datasets. This specific dataset was published by Kumar Rajarshi, who obtained the raw data from the
World Health Organisation (WHO) data repository which keeps track of various different factors including
the health status of countries around the world. This data repository can be found on the United Nations
(UN) website and has been made available to the general public by the UN for the purpose of health data
analysis. Whilst there was some transformation and cleaning of the dataset, it was undertaken to address the
issue of missing values and was handled using the Missmap command in R. As a result, the final dataset
which we utilised - containing 22 columns and 2938 rows, showcasing results for 20 predicting variables
was highly reliable with credible raw data sources and effective data cleaning and transformation processes
which were well documented.

### Right to Data Analysis

As the initial raw data was obtained from the United Nations website which allows the general public to
utilise its datasets, Kumar Rajarshi had the right to utilise the dataset. Further, with Kaggle allowing its’
users to obtain datasets published on the website, we also had the right to utilise the uploaded dataset which
means that there were no infringements of any rights when we analysed this data.

### Data Format & Content Analysis

The final dataset represents 20 predicting variables through 22 Columns and 2938 rows.

## Measures of Socioeconomic Status
### Data Source Analysis
This specific dataset was compiled and published by Shawn Dorius, who obtained the raw data from a
variety of sources. The main sources utilised in compiling this dataset were the 2004 publication of “The
World Economy: Historical Statistics” by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), the World Development Indicators Database for Years of Education, Volume 104 of the Journal of
Development Economics: “A New Data Set of Educational Attainment in the World, 1950-2010” and the
2009 United Nations Population Division. As these sources are mainly independent world bodies such as the
OECD and UN, which are renowned for high quality data publication, it is clear that the raw data utilised by
Shawn Dorius was of great accuracy. Whilst the data was compiled from different sources, there was no
manipulation of any data points in the compilation process, maintaining the overall accuracy of the dataset.
Thus, the final dataset which we utilised - containing 8 columns and 2087 rows, showcasing results for 4
predicting variables - was highly reliable with credible raw data sources and clear data compilation.

### Right to Data Analysis

As the initial raw data was obtained from sources such as the United Nations website which allows the
general public to utilise its datasets, along with various different publications made available to the general
public, Shawn Dorius had the right to utilise the dataset. Further, with Kaggle allowing its’ users to obtain
datasets published on the website, we also had the right to utilise the uploaded dataset which means that
there were no infringements of any rights when we analysed this dataset.

### Data Format & Content Analysis

The final dataset represents 4 predicting variables through 8 Columns and 2087 rows.

## Measures Relating to Economic Freedom
### Data Source Analysis
This specific dataset was published by Guillermina Sutter Schneider, who obtained the raw data from the
Economic Freedom of the World: 2018 Annual Report which is published by the Fraser Institute, a
recognised Canadian charity and public policy think tank. As the dataset is a copy of the data tables utilised
in the 2018 report, there has been no cleaning or transformation of data. Therefore, the final dataset which
we utilised - containing 36 columns and 3727 rows, showcasing results for 33 predicting variables - was
highly reliable with a credible raw data source.

### Right to Data Analysis
As the initial raw data was obtained from the Economic Freedom of the World: 2018 Annual Report which
is a publication for the general public, Guillermina Sutter Scneider had the right to utilise the datasets within
the report. Further, with Kaggle allowing its’ users to obtain datasets published on the website, we were able
to utilise the uploaded dataset without violating any data ownership rights.

### Data Format & Content Analysis
Variable Analysis:
· Variables including the digit 1 in its heading represent factors relating to the size of the government of
the country
· Variables including the digit 2 in its heading represent factors relating to the legal system and property
rights within the country
· Variables including the digit 3 in its heading represent factors relating to the sound money of the country
· Variables including the digit 4 in its heading represent factors relating to the country’s freedom to trade
internationally
· Variables including the digit 5 in its heading represent factors relating to regulation in the country

The final dataset represents 33 predicting variables through 36 Columns and X rows.
